# McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the nutritional content of items on the McDonald's menu. By examining various nutritional metrics such as calorie content, fats, sugars, and vitamins, we seek to provide insights into healthier dining options, compare nutritional values across different menu categories, and identify trends in fast-food nutrition.

# Dataset Description
The dataset encompasses detailed nutritional information for McDonald's menu items across several categories including Breakfast, Beverages, Burgers, and more. Each entry includes:

Category: The menu category to which the item belongs.
Item: The name of the menu item.
Serving Size: The serving size of the item.
Calories: Caloric content of the item.
Total Fat, Saturated Fat, Trans Fat: Fat content measurements in grams and their daily value percentages.
Cholesterol, Sodium: Content measurements in milligrams and their daily value percentages.
Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Sugars, Protein: Macronutrient content measurements in grams and their daily value percentages.
Vitamins and Minerals (A, C, Calcium, Iron): Vitamin and mineral content percentages of daily value.
